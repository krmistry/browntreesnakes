## Individual-based Generating Model

Initial conditions and rough model structure:

-   25 individuals to start (to run faster)

-   Time step is days

-   In each time step, each individual:

    -   Has a probability of growing (Poisson based on the Gompertz growth function? Not quite sure yet, start with a static value as the Poisson lambda)

        -   Maybe this should be a Bernoulli too - sometimes there's no growth, and that could be relatively easy to add density dependence to; $p$ would change based on the density, so the probability of growing at all changes, independent of the actual growth rate

    -   Has a probability of reproducing (Bernoulli, then Poisson for number of offspring? Or just Poisson?)

        -   Same as for growth, having a Bernoulli element might make density dependence easier to incorporate

    -   Has a probability of dying from natural causes (Bernoulli)

-   Initial run time is 90 days (\~1 quarter); may need to run it longer to get much population movement, but start with this

```{r linear_growth_fun}

## This first version has linear growth, and the entire function will probably change when I get around to making growth non-linear (with the Gompertz functions from the growth paper)

## Inputs
# snake - 1 snake, i.e. one row of dataframe of current population (columns are ID, sex and size)
# density_prob - probability (0 - 1) for the Bernoulli probability for whether or not growth occurs
# growth_rates - dataframe of 3 linear growth rates (for small, medium and large snakes' growth) for each sex, constructed using Nafus et al. 2021 values ---- THIS WILL CHANGE


## Growth rates for linear, size-based growth (based on Nafus et al. 2021 rates, which were distinct for these size bins: <750, 750 - 1000 and >1000 (different from my size bins)

### Reproduction

-   Occurs once per quarter, and the females that reproduce in a given quarter do not grow and are not available to natural mortality

-   There are two pieces to determining how many offspring are produced:

    -   Bernoulli draw to determine if a female reproduces (this parameter will be the place that density dependence can be added)

    -   For females that reproduce, a Poisson draw with lambda = 2.3 determines how many offspring each individual produces

-   Offspring join the population at the beginning of the next quarter

    -   Beginning sizes drawn from a U(350,400))

    -   Sex is randomly assigned, with 50% probability

```{r reproduction_fun}

## Reproduction - occurs every 90 days; two ways to do this, either in one step or two. In the two step version, the first step is do they reproduce? Then, if they do, the number of offspring comes from a Poisson distribution. Same as with growth, this might make density dependence easier to incorporate by doing this in the first step. Alternatively, this could be done in a single step, with a draw from a Poisson, after isolating the females that could reproduce size-wise

## Each step needs its own function (so that the females not selected to reproduce can stay in the general population and go through the growth and mortality for loop)


# Setting up the probability of reproduction for each snake based on their size
# For now, it's based on Savidge et al. 2007 findings, which indicated that 90% of female   snakes reached sexual maturity between 910 and 1,025 SVL (doesn't mean that each            snake has a 90% probability of reproducing in that quarter though - LOOK AT THIS   AGAIN    LATER, it definitely needs to be revised)
# Using 90% confidence intervals for sexual maturity to calculate standard deviation and mean 
maturity_mean <- 910 + (1025-910)/2
maturity_sd <- (1025-910)/3.29

maturity_fun <- function(snake_SVL) {
    if(snake_SVL < 910) {
      maturity <- 0
    } else if (snake_SVL >= 910 & snake_SVL < 1025) {
      maturity <- pnorm(snake_SVL, maturity_mean, maturity_sd)
    } else {
      maturity <- 1
    }

#### Density dependence of vital rates (growth and reproduction)

The Bernoulli draw for both growth and reproduction should be influenced by density dependence. My first attempt at this will use the pdf of the half-normal distribution, scaled to produce a 0 - 1 value (with 0 indicating no density dependence, and 1 indicating that the population is at carrying capacity)

Density estimates from various sources, at different times (use to create default estimates for density per hectare and to create estimates of carrying capacity)

-   Rodda and Savidge, 2007:

    -   Estimated peak density in favorable habitats in the 1980s was probably \>100/ha

        -   In this period, the bird species were being extirpated, and this level of density meant that carrying capacity was exceeded once the prey species were depleted. Individual snake condition abruptly became skinnier in the early 1980s

    -   The population appeared to reach a dynamic equilibrium at "roughly half the estimated peak density in the 1980s" - so \~50/ha? The population appears to be stable since then

-   Rodda et al. 1992:

    -   Estimated from multiple study sites around the western and northern parts of the island, surveyed from 1985 - 1990:

        -   Using CAPTURE software and mark-recapture data, they calculated these densities in different study areas:

            -   Northern Guam: 20/ha (16.5 - 24) in 1.88 ha area in 1985, 34/ha (7 - 62) in 1.5 ha area in 1989. Extrapolating from that, they estimate that a total of 119/ha and using a different calculation, 112/ha

            -   Central Guam: 63/ha (45 - 108) for a 2 ha study area using Schumacher technique, CAPTURE estimated 58/ha (18 - 97) - although the CAPTURE assumptions were violated, but in small ways

                -   Central had had snakes for longer, so during this study period, snakes had probably already peaked (birds and bats were already depleted)

### Eradication methods

The primary eradicaton methods are:

-   ADS

    -   Sizes affected: there's a minimum size based on prey attraction (only snakes that have converted to eating mammals will eat the neonatal mice baits), and less well defined maximum size (large snakes are unlikely to be attracted to the neonatal mice because they're too small, and the really large ones may not be killed by the standard acetaminophen dose)

        -   To start with, 850 is the minimum and 1200 is the maximum *(based on my instinct - check this later)*

    -   Coverage percentage: defined by how much of the area is seeded with baits, and this is solely determining the encounter probability for now (100% coverage assumes that all snakes will encounter a bait)

        -   50% as default to start with

    -   Mortality probability:

        -   Based on the size affected range - 0 outside that range, and a high probability if encountered: 95% as default *(based on my instinct, check this later)*

    -   Effective time (amount of time after application when death may occur): the mice baits decompose quite quickly, so they'll only be available to be eaten for a short time.

        -   2 days is the default to start with *(based on my instinct - check this later)*

    -   Number of applications in 30 day period:

        -   3 applications in 3 weeks *(based on my instinct - check this later)*

    -   Basic elements of equations:

        -   coverage determines how many snakes could encounter a bait (percentage of coverage = percentage of snakes, so assuming even distribution), then using a bernoulli to determine how many of those encounter it

        -   For parameter in Bernoulli: encounter probability is based on size (0 outside the size affected range, and the same probability for all others to start with)

        -   Mortality if encountered is another Bernoulli, if its separated from encounter (currently, encounter = mortality)

        -   In the day loop, have 3 applications 7 days apart in 1 quarter per year for final 2 years of time series to start with (to give the population a burn in period - eventually this may be unnecessary, and I could just run for the period of time that the applications are actively occurring, hopefully)

-   Visual survey

    -   Sizes affected: all sizes, although I should look to see if there is some variation in detection based on size

        -   Default is equal detection for all sizes

    -   Coverage: how many transects, and how much of the area is covered based on an expected amount of area covered in each transect

        -   50% coverage as default *(based on my instinct - check this later)*

    -   Effective time:

-   Live traps

    -   Sizes affected:

    -   Coverage:

    -   Effective time:

-   Bait tubes

    -   Sizes affected:

    -   Coverage:

    -   Effective time:

#### Effort

All of the eradication methods needs to include a metric for effort - I think it should all be in the same units, probably. Area covered is one type of effort, which I'm already using, but is that good enough? I think it should probably include how many hours the eradication method is available. So maybe something like $h_j*c_j$ with $h_j$ = number of hours per day and for eradication method $j$ and $c_j$ = proportion of area covered by eradication method $j$.

-   ADS: $h_1 = 24$ hours (or 12, if we just count when the snacks are active) over the coverage

-   Visual: $h_2 = 4$ hours (or whatever the standard number of hours to search

-   Trap: $h_3 = 24$ hours (or, again, 12)

Instead of using the actual number of hours, I could instead standardize this to be the proportion of the day (24/24, 4/24, or if only counting night hours then 12/12 and 4/12), which would standardize this. It would also mean that the product ($h*c$) would be between 0 and 1, like what Jess did.

### Eradication mortality at high SVL for toxic baits

#### Option 1: Exponential decay

General exponential decay function, with 1400 being the point at which mortality/encounter probability begins to decay (based on Shane's info, to be fine tuned later)

$$
y = b^{(SVL-1400)}
$$

$b$ is the growth factor, and needs to be between 0 and 1. I'll have to experiment with this to pick a value (or a range of values).

I initially tried a very wide range of b values (0.01 to 0.99 in increments of 0.01, so 100 values), and based on this, I narrowed the range to values above 0.9, so that there is at least some probability above 1500 mm SVL (below b = 0.9, there is basically no probability of mortality above 1450 mm SVL, which doesn't match what Shane said).

```{r mortality_decay-exponential}

## Decreasing mortality/encounter probability for toxic bait methods (ADS & bait tubes)

# Trying out different b values for exponential decay
b_options <- seq(0.90, 0.999, 0.005)
b_results <- list()
for(b in 1:length(b_options)) {
  x <- seq(1401, max(unlist(gompertz_asymptotes)), 5)
  y <- b_options[b]^(x-1400)
  b_results[[b]] <- as.data.frame(cbind(x,y))
  colnames(b_results[[b]]) <- c("SVL", "mortality_prob")
}
names(b_results) <- b_options
b_results_melt <- melt(b_results, id.vars = c(colnames(b_results[[1]])))
colnames(b_results_melt)[3] <- "b_option"
b_results_melt$b_option <- factor(b_results_melt$b_option, levels = b_options)

b_options_plot <- ggplot(b_results_melt) +
  geom_line(aes(x = SVL, y = mortality_prob, color = b_option)) +
  theme_bw()


# If 1600 is when 50% mortality occurs, then this would be the decay function:
x <- seq(1401, max(unlist(gompertz_asymptotes)), 5)
y <- (0.5^(1/200))^(x-1400)
b_0.9965 <- as.data.frame(cbind(x,y))
colnames(b_0.9965) <- c("SVL", "mortality_prob")

ggplot(b_0.9965) +
  geom_line(aes(x = SVL, y = mortality_prob))
```

#### Option 2: Gaussian decay

If we believe that decay has a longer plateau then a sharp decline, then I could use a Gaussian decay function, with the format:

$$
y = e^{\frac{-x^2}{d}}
$$

$d$ is a scale parameter, which dictates how far out the tail stretches (and hence how quickly the sharp decay occurs).

I initially tried seq(1500, 2500, 100) for the d values, and this produced very low probabilities above 1500 for any of them, with very fast decay between 1400 and 1450, so I greatly increased the range of d.

For now, going with $d = 2100$, which puts the 50% mortality rate at about 1525 mm SVL.

```{r mortality_decay-gaussian}

# Trying out different b values for exponential decay
d_options <- seq(1000, 50000, 5000)
d_results <- list()
for(d in 1:length(d_options)) {
  x <- seq(1401, max(unlist(gompertz_asymptotes)), 5)
  y <- exp(-((x-1400)^2/d_options[d]))
  d_results[[d]] <- as.data.frame(cbind(x,y))
  colnames(d_results[[d]]) <- c("SVL", "mortality_prob")
}
names(d_results) <- d_options
d_results_melt <- melt(d_results, id.vars = c(colnames(d_results[[1]])))
colnames(d_results_melt)[3] <- "d_option"
d_results_melt$d_option <- factor(d_results_melt$d_option, levels = d_options)

d_options_plot <- ggplot(d_results_melt) +
  geom_line(aes(x = SVL, y = mortality_prob, color = d_option)) +
  theme_bw()


# Combining both types of decay functions, just to more directly compare them
d_results_melt$method <- "gauss"
b_results_melt$method <- "exp"
d_results_melt$d_option <- paste0("d_", d_results_melt$d_option)
b_results_melt$b_option <- paste0("b_", b_results_melt$b_option)
colnames(d_results_melt)[3] <- "scale_par"
colnames(b_results_melt)[3] <- "scale_par"
all_results <- rbind(d_results_melt, b_results_melt)

ggplot(all_results, aes(x = SVL, y = mortality_prob, color = method, group = scale_par)) +
  geom_path() +
  theme_bw() 
  

```

```{r size_based_toxic_bait_mortality}

# Plotting entire surface of mortality probability by SVL size, using the diet transition and
# decay functions, as they currently are (scale parameters and even form of decay function  may change in the future)

SVL <- seq(350, 1850, 5)
mortality <- vector()
for(snake in 1:length(SVL)) {
  mortality[snake] <- mortality_prob[[1]][1]*diet_trans_fun(SVL[snake])*mortality_decay_fun(SVL[snake])
}

ggplot(as.data.frame(cbind(SVL, mortality))) +
  geom_line(aes(x = SVL, y = mortality)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mortality_prob[[1]][1], color = "blue") +
