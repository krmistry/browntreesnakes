## Basic Brown Tree Snakes management model

### First step: Generating model

Size-structured model with 4 size classes. The simplest version I'll start with is has growth rates between size classes, reproductive rates for the 3 larger size classes and death rates for all. The model is discrete, with a time step equaling 3 months.

The entire population in time step t ($N_t$) is defined as:

$$
N_t = \sum_{i = 1}^{4} n_{i,t}
$$

The population of the first size class ($n_{1,t}$), is defined as:

$$
n_{i,t} = [1 - (\alpha_1 + d_1)] n_{1,t-1} + \sum_{n=2}^{4} r_i*n_{i, t-1}  
$$

The second size classes ($n_{2,t}$) is defined as:

$$
n_{2,t} = [1-(\alpha_2 + d_2)]n_{2, t-1} + \alpha_1*n_{1,t-1}
$$

The third size classes ($n_{3,t}$) is defined as:

$$
n_{3,t} = [1-(\alpha_3 + d_3)]n_{3, t-1} + \alpha_2*n_{2,t-1}
$$

The fourth and final size class ($n_{4,t}$) is defined as:

$$
n_{4,t} = (1-d_4)n_{4,t-1} + \alpha_3*n_{3,t-1}
$$
